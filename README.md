# credit-risk-classification
Module 20 Challenge

## Report

## Overview of the Analysis

The exercise creates a machine learning model to analyse and learn from the data provided and predict the accuracy of new loans. The dataset provided the typical information required for a loan aplication.
The outcome is to predict the loan_status value (0 low risk or 1 high risk)

MAchine learning stages
    * Data Preparation: get the data and separated features (X) and (y).
    * Data Splitting: Split the data into training and testing sets in the standard form (70-30)
    * Model Training: Traine the model using splitted train data
    * Create confussion matrix
    * Model Report: Retrieve results on accuracy of prediction, false positives and negatives

`LogisticRegression` was used : This type of statistical model (also known as logit model) is often used for classification and predictive analytics. Since the outcome is a probability, the dependent variable is bounded between 0 and 1. In logistic regression, a logit transformation is applied on the odds—that is, the probability of success divided by the probability of failure.

## Results

The accuracy achieved was 0.99

## Summary

Logistic Regression model can well predict loan outcome for this dataset.

## Background
In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

Before You Begin
Create a new repository for this project called credit-risk-classification. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.

Clone the new repository to your computer.

Inside your credit-risk-classification repository, create a folder titled "Credit_Risk."

Inside the "Credit_Risk" folder, add the credit_risk_classification.ipynb and lending_data.csv files found in the "Starter_Code.zip" file.

Push your changes to GitHub.

Files
Download the following files to help you get started:

Instructions
The instructions for this Challenge are divided into the following subsections:

Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
Open the starter code notebook and use it to complete the following steps:

Read the lending_data.csv data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame.

Create the labels set (y) from the “loan_status” column, and then create the features (X) DataFrame from the remaining columns.

note
A value of 0 in the “loan_status” column means that the loan is healthy. A value of 1 means that the loan has a high risk of defaulting.

Split the data into training and testing datasets by using train_test_split.

Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
Use your knowledge of logistic regression to complete the following steps:

Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (X_train and y_train).

Save the predictions for the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (X_test) and the fitted model.

Evaluate the model’s performance by doing the following:

Generate a confusion matrix.

Print the classification report.

Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?

Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report
Write a brief report that includes a summary and analysis of the performance of the machine learning models that you used in this homework. You should write this report as the README.md file included in your GitHub repository.

Structure your report by using the report template that Starter_Code.zip includes, ensuring that it contains the following:

An overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The results: Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.

A summary: Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you don’t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.
